# Hello world!

Hi there! My name is Henrique.

The creation of this Python package was intended to create a simple solution for extracting daily data from XCO2 retrieved from the GES DISC platform.

I will leave the GitHub profile of the researchers who helped me in the graphical visualization of the data and the citation of the OCO-2 project.

I hope it's useful to you. Long live science!
